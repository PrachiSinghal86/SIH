Publishers can include snippets of Javascript in their site, and Developers can integrate with our Mobile Ads SDK, and they are done.

When the customer clicks on that ad, he/she gets redirected to Amazon or to the advertiser site. We have systems that monitor the customer actions as they make purchases, and we initiate payment to the Publisher or Developer for enabling the transaction. In other words, you will be working on products and solutions that enable us to place highly effective advertisements on a variety of Publishing sources, websites, Mobile apps, Tablet apps, gaming devices, TVs etc. You will be competing in a cutting edge space with other Advertising giants like Google, Yahoo, Facebook and a Microsoft with your products, and have tremendous business impact.
