Second level professional with direct impact on results and outcome.
Your future duties and responsibilities:

Atlassian JIRA - bug tracking, issue tracking, communication, and project management
CGI Ensemble (Microsoft Workspace) Understanding of:
Jenkins Build Server and continuous integration The developers are responsible for producing the code for the application. Initially the responsibilities will be fixing bugs, errors and performance issues, and making sure these are at a testable state in compliance with the given tasks, system documentation and strategic goals. As the developers become more confident with the application, the architecture and the overall domain, tasks such as application modernization (i.e. modernizing the application to a micro service component based architecture) and development of new functionality will be part of the tasks given to the development team.
The developers in the development team must have a deep knowledge of Java, Wilfly and Microsoft SQL, being able to code both front-end and back-end code. Furthermore, it is preferred that they have knowledge of either GWT or Apache Struts. Old screens of the application are made in Apache Struts; as these screens are still maintained, it is relevant to have competences capable of maintaining these. However, all new screens and modernization of older screens are completed with GWT, thus making GWT the future front-end tool. Finally, it is a big plus, if the developers have experience with writing unit tests, using Atlassian JIRA and CGI Ensemble (Microsoft Workspace) and have knowledge or experience with continuous integration (e.g. through Jenkins Build servers). Experience in the Image processing tool like image example.

Software Engineer - Tools,"Bengaluru, Karnataka",Drishti Technologies,None,Organic,"Software Tools Engineer

Engineering | Bangalore, Karnataka, India

Join Drishti to solve a 100-year-old problem in a $12 trillion dollar market.
Deep learning-driven action recognition is the next frontier for AI. Build it with us.

Drishti’s mission is to “extend human potential in an increasingly automated world.” We’re driving true digital transformation in manufacturing by, for the first time since Henry Ford, making manual processes visible to factory analytics. We’re producing, collecting and analyzing massive amounts of data as we build manufacturing’s first and only solution for deep learning-driven action recognition.

About this role
Drishti’s Software Tools engineer is responsible for helping design and build Labelling Tools for self service portals for enabling customers to label the data sets and see the results of the datasets for analytics.
He/She be a self-starter who can work independently, but also coordinate and communicate effectively with a cross-continental team.

How this helps your career
Our system is a full stack AI and machine learning company. This role includes learning things in the following areas:
1. Video streaming and storage
2. Neural networks and deep learning
3. Networking and cloud deployment for cameras
4. Modeling the data for manufacturing use cases, which generates gigabytes of storage
5. Hybrid cloud-based system
6. Automated labeling systems for AI
7. Generating insights from the generated data

Your exposure to all of the above will provide you with a good systems understanding and make you a well-rounded and skilled engineer in the future.

Minimum qualifications
Bachelor Degree in Computer Science, Information Systems, Engineering or a related scientific or technical discipline.
At least 4-8 years of experience in automating tools for data pipelines in distributed systems/web-based services/databases
Experience in NoSQL and relational databases and related ETL jobs and orchestrators.
Experience in software development in at least two or more general purpose programming languages, including but not limited to C/C++, Python, Java or Go
Experience in Linux-based development environment and exposure to at least one cloud stack, e.g., GCP, Azure or AWS.
Preferred qualifications
Master’s degree in Engineering
Experience with one or more of: event-driven and microservices architectures, computer vision, video pipelines, AI/ML would be a strong plus
Experience working in a venture-backed software startup developing solutions with demonstrated scaling and/or experience in a large, cloud-based enterprises
Experience designing multi-tenant SaaS applications
Familiarity with DevOps practices and tools
Five reasons to work at Drishti

1. Work with visionaries who can execute: Our leadership team is comprised of heavy hitters from the AI and deep learning world. Check out their patents and publications, and see how their histories intertwine with the biggest movements in the last 30 years of technology. And imagine being on a first name basis with them, solving hard technical problems side-by-side.
2. Tackle a massive market challenge: Manufacturing is a $12T industry that still uses 100-year-old techniques to gather data on human tasks. Which means that people, who still perform nearly 75 percent of factory activities, are effectively invisible to analytics. This situation severely hinders the decision-making abilities of the world’s largest manufacturing brands. The demand for a solution couldn’t be larger.
3. Do what you love – solve problems using tech: A problem of this magnitude requires the full force of technological solutions. You’ll take on neural network model accuracy, high-volume video transit and storage, Big Data analysis and much more. It’s the challenge – and the madness, and the fun – of building an SAP on top of a YouTube on top of a Nest.
4. Lead the charge from Bangalore: Drishti is based in Silicon Valley, and funded by top venture capital investors that include Andreessen Horowitz, Emergence Capital and BGV. But – and this is critical for you – Drishti is building its product out of Bangalore. From our CTO on down, Bangalore is the heart and soul of Drishti’s engineering. You’ll be at the center of the action.
5. Get exposure to deep learning: Deep learning technology is fundamental to what we do, and select engineers at Drishti have the opportunity to rotate into our deep learning group, to work alongside some of the foremost experts in the field."

Drishti’s mission is to “extend human potential in an increasingly automated world.” We’re driving true digital transformation in manufacturing by, for the first time since Henry Ford, making manual processes visible to factory analytics. We’re producing, collecting and analyzing massive amounts of data as we build manufacturing’s first and only solution for deep learning-driven action recognition.

About this role
Drishti’s Software Tools engineer is responsible for helping design and build Labelling Tools for self service portals for enabling customers to label the data sets and see the results of the datasets for analytics.

Familiarity with DevOps practices and tools
Five reasons to work at Drishti

1. Work with visionaries who can execute: Our leadership team is comprised of heavy hitters from the AI and deep learning world. Check out their patents and publications, and see how their histories intertwine with the biggest movements in the last 30 years of technology. And imagine being on a first name basis with them, solving hard technical problems side-by-side.
2. Tackle a massive market challenge: Manufacturing is a $12T industry that still uses 100-year-old techniques to gather data on human tasks. Which means that people, who still perform nearly 75 percent of factory activities, are effectively invisible to analytics. This situation severely hinders the decision-making abilities of the world’s largest manufacturing brands. The demand for a solution couldn’t be larger.
3. Do what you love – solve problems using tech: A problem of this magnitude requires the full force of technological solutions. You’ll take on neural network model accuracy, high-volume video transit and storage, Big Data analysis and much more. It’s the challenge – and the madness, and the fun – of building an SAP on top of a YouTube on top of a Nest.
4. Lead the charge from Bangalore: Drishti is based in Silicon Valley, and funded by top venture capital investors that include Andreessen Horowitz, Emergence Capital and BGV. But – and this is critical for you – Drishti is building its product out of Bangalore. From our CTO on down, Bangalore is the heart and soul of Drishti’s engineering. You’ll be at the center of the action.
5. Get exposure to deep learning: Deep learning technology is fundamental to what we do, and select engineers at Drishti have the opportunity to rotate into our deep learning group, to work alongside some of the foremost experts in the field."
