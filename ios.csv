Upkeep of general iOS codebase at Zomato - keeping SDKs, libraries up to date, ensuring latest security patches to libraries are pulled in
Maintain and evolve the architecture of multiple Zomato iOS apps
Build reusable libraries, toolkits and developer tools for usage across multiple mobile teams on Zomato
Own the process of ensuring our apps are always highly reliable and performant. Always targeting 100% crash free users
Discover, design, develop, deploy, debug. Repeat!

Job description

Zomato as an organisation has grown and scaled multifold over the last few years. We are committed to bringing the best food to everyone; no matter who they are and what they can afford.

To know more about what’s cooking at Zomato, here is our Annual Report FY’19 and and half year financial report FY2020. Creating and re-inventing has been a key practice at Zomato and at this point we require folks who can help us keep pace with the dynamic ecosystem we are all a part of. Check out how life at Zomato looks like and our blog for all the latest updates.

About the role

Zomato is more than 8 years old on the iTunes Store, and one of the top apps. In 19 countries, the de facto way people order or discover food is Zomato. We have been delighting users and helping them chalk their food journeys for the greater part of this decade.

The mobile platform team at Zomato works on performance, reliability and sustainability of our mobile properties. As a member of the platform team, you are expected to be always on the lookout for performance and reliability issues, and not just fix them, but ensure an architecture that does not lead to them in the first place.

You should have been working on iOS for at least the last several Xcode releases and know how to delight iOS users. Whenever you are using an app, you are always looking for tiny design inconsistencies, the little stutter, the loader that spun for too long and imagining what might have been the cause for it.

Here's what you'll do everyday:
Upkeep of general iOS codebase at Zomato - keeping SDKs, libraries up to date, ensuring latest security patches to libraries are pulled in
Maintain and evolve the architecture of multiple Zomato iOS apps
Build reusable libraries, toolkits and developer tools for usage across multiple mobile teams on Zomato
Own the process of ensuring our apps are always highly reliable and performant. Always targeting 100% crash free users
Discover, design, develop, deploy, debug. Repeat!


Requirements

Who fits the bill?
2-5 years of experience with Objective-C, C/C++ and Swift and native iOS Development
Well versed with the internals of build and packaging tools like Cocoapods, Carthage
Strong computer science fundamentals - equivalent of a CS/IT bachelors degree
Experience using and maintaining CI/CD pipelines
Inclination towards writing tests, following TDD
Understanding of MVVM, MVP, MVC, Viper models and the ability to choose based on situations","Zomato
