Do you want to be part of a global movement for improving the quality of lives for people and significantly enhance your own life in the process?
Are you tired of dead-end jobs with even more “dead” (or constipated) people around yourself and you seek to make your life, your career and yourself matter?
Are you willing to be part of a team of “rebels” who, since 2003, have gone through successes, failures, mistakes and great victories to create a small but truly outstanding company that is daring to dream globally and already somewhat on its way?
If yes, then you may want to be part of our Tribe and get on the ride?
Through a journey of many ups and downs, we have created ( and are still creating) a company that has offered the very best travel experiences to people that money can buy. And in the process, have operations in 5 Asian countries (India, Thailand, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Nepal) and have managed to create a global distribution network in 35 countries worldwide.
We have done this through creating a thriving business and following our values of always doing what is right, taking care of each other, doing more things with less and making continuous improvements.
Idex is not a place for the meek or even for those who have been brain-damaged to believe that only people formal education in some “top-notch” educational institutions can have amazing careers and worth in the world. Idex is not a place for those who are happy with the status-quo. Its only fit for those with ambitions. Ambitions for a great life for themselves and for making a difference in the world.
And while we are situated in the rather dull and boring city of Jaipur in India, our fan-base is global. And so are our ambitions.
We are committed to and making strong progress towards our 20-year goal to serve 5 million people annually and get there by continuously challenging ourselves for creating innovative service solutions, providing great value to our customers, elevating lives of our stakeholders, disrupting already existing ways of doing things and making an impact globally.

UX Developer,India,Crypto Mize,None,Organic,"UX Developer Responsibilities
User experience (UX) is a person’s emotions and attitudes about using a particular product, system or service. It includes the practical, experiential, affective, meaningful and valuable aspects of human–computer interaction and product ownership. Additionally, it includes a person’s perceptions of system aspects such as utility, ease of use and efficiency.
User experience may be subjective in nature to the degree that it is about individual perception and thought with respect to a product or system. User experience varies dynamically, constantly modifying over time due to changing usage circumstances. Simplified, user experience is about how a user interacts with, and experiences, a product.
UX developers, also known as user experience developers, plan, design, and develop web applications and web pages using code and visual design tools. Companies that want to appeal to consumers hire UX developers to work full time, although some work for themselves as independent contractors. UX developers work independently but collaborate with the rest of the development team to design various web applications and programs.
A UI/UX developer is responsible for the website or application experience of visitors. UI/UX Developers must have a great understanding of user behavior and can be viewed as part psychologist and part web developer. Usually, good UX developers will understand how to align business/marketing goals with technology. Writing a good job description for a UI/UX developer will require you to understand the skills and responsibilities needed for the specific project and ongoing work.
