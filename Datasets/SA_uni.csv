Linux System Administrator,"Bengaluru, Karnataka",vepsun technologies,"₹25,000 - ₹35,000 a month","Linux Administrator Job Description
Linux administrators are back-end IT specialists who install, configure, and maintain Linux operating systems in a variety of organizations. This role involves server-side operations and troubleshooting tasks that support business-critical and development activities. Linux administrators also configure user access and monitor system stability and security through deployment and everyday use.
This role requires extensive familiarity with Linux systems and servers and may involve a high level of risk assessment and user support. Because Linux is an open-source operating system, administrators also frequently communicate and collaborate with other developers to develop and implement system enhancements.
Linux Administrator Duties and ResponsibilitiesWhile the specific duties of a Linux administrator can vary based on their business and industry, the general responsibilities of this role are relatively consistent. Based on listings that we analyzed, these duties include:
Install and Configure Linux Systems
A Linux administrator’s main responsibility is to install and set up Linux systems and servers, often for organization-wide deployment. They develop servers and work with individual users to ensure that the system works reliably and quickly and answer questions related to setup and installation. In this role, Linux administrators also set up the architecture of the system, including back-end databases and scripts for specific applications and use cases.
Perform System Maintenance
Linux administrators also perform routine system maintenance and resolve server-side issues as they arise. This aspect of the role requires the Linux administrator to review error logs and reported errors and seek out solutions. Frequently, Linux administrators need to work directly with the system’s source code to make necessary changes to ensure reliable performance and then deploy those changes throughout the system.
Create System Backups
Linux administrators also conduct system backups according to company or industry standards. They may perform these backups weekly, daily, or more frequently depending on system space and business needs. This improves system recovery after a crash or other outage and supports data integrity by ensuring that there is never a massive loss of vital information.
Monitor System Performance
In addition to maintaining Linux systems and servers, Linux administrators also monitor system performance to prevent slowdowns and crashes. They may examine daily traffic logs and reports or receive direct reports from end users. If the Linux administrator notices potential issues or recurring problems within the system, they develop and deploy solutions so that the system remains usable for all personnel.
Provide Technical Support and Guidance
Linux administrators provide technical support and guidance to users and other administrators. In many cases, the Linux administrator works closely with other developers to answer technical questions or resolve issues with server-side performance. They may also support users by assisting with installation and maintenance of Linux-based programs and help debug these applications so that they work with existing servers.
Maintain System Security
Finally, Linux administrators maintain system security by actively identifying faults and vulnerable areas within the system’s architecture. This part of the job requires extensive knowledge of viruses and other sources of system vulnerability, and requires the Linux administrator to proactively develop protections, particularly when deploying system-wide changes that can open up new vulnerabilities.

System Admin@Hyderabad,"Hyderabad, Telangana",Sahasya Global Solutions,None,"Job Description:
Questionaire
o365 questions:

Can we set permissions within SharePoint when using O365 Groups? For example, reader, contributor, etc.
Ans : No
Q: the licenses are reusable correct? meaning, once you delete the group or person the license is then used for another user?
Ans : Creating a group, adding members or removing members has no impact to your license consumption.As Office 365 Groups simply require users to be licensed for the appropriate services (Enterprise, Business, Education SKUs, etc.).
Give me migration options in o365
Ans : Hybrid, Cutover,Staged and Imap.
What are the three main identity models Azure Active Directory users to manage user authentication in Office 365?

Ans : Cloud Identity
Synchronized Identity
Federated Identity.

Q . What’s the benefit of using a hybrid type over the other migration types?

A hybrid deployment offers organizations the ability to extend the feature-rich experience and administrative control they have with their existing on-premises Microsoft Exchange organization to the cloud. A hybrid deployment provides the seamless look and feel of a single Exchange organization between an on-premises Exchange Server 2013 organization and Exchange Online in Microsoft Office 365. In addition, a hybrid deployment can serve as an intermediate step to move completely to an Exchange Online organization.

Do you know what DirSync is? What is it used for?

A3: DirSync, as known as the Azure Active Directory Sync tool, synchronizes your on-premises Active Directory users to Office 365. For details, I suggest you refer to: Plan for directory synchronization for Office 365.

How will the user know if their mailbox has been moved to the cloud?

In a hybrid deployment, once we have the Hybrid setup in place, and then Migrate that particular users mailbox to the cloud, exchange will push an update of those settings to that user. The user will get a notification ‘the administrator has updated your settings and you must restart outlook’. Once Outlook restarts, their RPC/HTTP settings will point to Office 365 automatically.

Designation – IT Content Design Sr. Analyst / Analyst

Do you like content, web designing and can work on mixed media? If the answer is yes, then join us as an IT Content Design Specialist.
The velocity and complexity of work today—not to mention always-evolving technologies and ever-shrinking attention spans—means it’s harder than ever to make messages stick. The pace at which we are providing new technologies is outpacing our ability to make people aware of them and to teach them how to work better.
Simply put, we need a more digitally fit work force. To do that, we develop a variety of engaging, easy-to-follow resources to help people get the most from these new technologies.
As a forward-thinking creative Content Design Specialist in the IT Technical Communication and Learning Services (ITTCLS) team, the bulk of the work will be generating content in a variety of media to ensure Micron team members are aware of and learn to use available IT products and services.
You will work regularly with the ITTCLS team and will have direct and regular contact with other Micron teams both within and outside of IT to make our internally used technologies more approachable and consumable. One day will be spent interviewing an IT operations manager to get some basic questions answered, and the next may be spent determining the right mix of media and information architecture to help a particular audience use collaboration tools more effectively or creating a one-page infographic to help users set up their mobile device to get work email while they are traveling.
The ideal candidate must be able to work independently, manage multiple activities at the same time, set priorities, and pivot to new tasks quickly. Creativity, organization and an eye for clean design are required. Candidates should be comfortable working independently or as part of a team. Collaboration with peers, leaders and global counterparts is required.
Responsibilities and Requirements
Advise, consult with domain experts to deliver on the design, development, and implementation of media solutions that support and promote effective use of available technologies.
Ability to organize complex systems of information so that users can find exactly what they’re looking for.
Work directly with internal customers to ensure consistency and continuity in project design and execution.
Have in-depth knowledge of Microsoft SharePoint architecture.
Support, assess, and communicate web site usage and security policies and standards.
Provide technical assistance to site administrators.
Design and produce internal media solutions to inform and engage team members with available technologies. Media solutions may include, but are not limited to, websites, presentations, videos, photos, brochures, infographics, e-learning, illustrations, and other visual identities.
Become familiar with Micron’s corporate and IT brand guidelines. Establish project-specific ‘brands’ and carry those through multiple deliverables (i.e., web, presentation, email, video, etc.).
Create standard operating procedures in contribution to a center of excellence that allows more self-service for communication and learning activities.
Collaborate with various Micron members organizational change specialists, communication specialists, training analysts, and other creatives in support of IT projects and other initiatives.
Qualifications
Familiarity with standard web and content design software and languages (i.e., Adobe Creative Cloud Suite, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) is a must.
Experience with SharePoint Online is required.
Should have experience with video editing and cinematography, and should know how to prepare presentations and work with mixed media such as photos, etc.
