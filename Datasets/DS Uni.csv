Quantum computers are incredibly powerful machines that take a new approach to processing information. Built on the principles of quantum mechanics, they exploit complex and fascinating laws of nature that are always there, but usually remain hidden from view. By harnessing such natural behavior, quantum computers can run new types of algorithms to process information more holistically. They may one day lead to revolutionary breakthroughs in materials and drug discovery, the optimization of complex manmade systems, and artificial intelligence. We expect them to open doors that we once thought would remain locked indefinitely.

Product Analytics Intern,"Gurgaon, Haryana",ATOM,None,Organic,"Job Location: Gurgaon, currently remote due to Covid-19
Compensation: Unpaid, The trade-off is between how much responsibility & learning vs getting some money. You’ll work directly with founders and own a large part of our entire product analytics piece.
Experience : Min. 6 months of hands-on experience in data-analytics for consumer products preferable at an early-stage
Our Vision
We're looking to recruit for the core team of our funded startup.
Less than 1% of people complete their New Year's resolution. Less than 9% do something about it after the first week.
We believe that the main challenge of our times is self-regulation and self discipline. For this, technology should be a solution and not the primary cause for distractions. We want to tackle this by using behavioural psychology, AI & games to help achieve our goals through small, byte sized habits.
Learn more about our product & vision here : http://bit.ly/AtmVsn
Who We Are
We have experience in building products as a core part of other startups (nearbuy, Limetray) and have used these opportunities to understand how to build technology businesses from the grounds-up. Gaurav and I are founders, and batchmates from NSIT CS, batch of 2013.
Who We Are Looking For
We are a team of about 5 right now and are looking to expand to 15. We need people across product, engineering and design. The way we see everyone's role at Atom is that everyone has a core competency which will be their primary responsibility, beyond which, each person has the right to choose to do more than just their role. We distribute tasks democratically and we will continue to do that as part of our culture.
Why should you join ?
The main takeaway for people wouldn't be the pay, if money is in your top three motivations to apply, I would discourage you from applying. We are at a point where we want to figure out product-market fit and as part of a small organisation you learn how to do that. Additionally, you will learn how to build and launch a consumer product for the western market, how to setup a team for a startup and more ownership in your field of work. Unless these aren't your priority, or if our vision doesn't appeal to you I would recommend against this profile.
Interview Process
We do this quite differently, for reasons that seem obvious to us. Basis your CV, we will have a video-call. Post that, we usually like people to come on board with us for 2-3 weeks and work with us. If you're already working, you can do this on weekends. We've seen this work well for us in previous startups mostly because it really helps us understand each other in terms of vision, culture and how we approach problems. This will definitely be more than an employer-employee relationship and we know that first 5-10 people in a startup are absolutely critical, perhaps even more so than founders. This ""trial"" helps both parties sort of de-risk the process.
If you've made it this far, congratulations. You've more focus than the majority. Let's finally get into the actual day-to-day
Responsibilities
Own and manage what to measure and what data to look out, in order to make the organisation more data-informed
Identifying what to measure, and the best way to do so through tools like Google Analytics, Amplitude, Mixpanel etc.
Work to prepare experiments and targets for every product launch
Understanding and working with data visualisation tools like tableau to enable teams to take better decision
Preparing reports based on analysis and communicating the same across the team
Identify, analyze, and interpret trends or patterns in complex data sets

"Analyst, Analytics and Insights, National Vector Borne Disea...","New Delhi, Delhi",Clinton Health Access Initiative,None,Organic,"Overview:
The Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc. (CHAI) is a global health organization committed to saving lives and reducing the burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, while strengthening the capabilities of governments and the private sector in those countries to create and sustain high-quality health systems that can succeed without our assistance. For more information, please visit: https://www.clintonhealthaccess.org

CHAI has been working in India since 2004 in partnership with, and under the guidance of, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) both at the central and state levels on an array of high priority initiatives aimed at improving health outcomes. Currently, CHAI works across projects to expand access to quality care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis-C, tuberculosis, cancer, health financing and immunization. Additionally, CHAI is supporting the government of Madhya Pradesh (MP) on large-scale programs to arrest childhood and maternal mortality due to malnutrition, anemia, diarrhea and pneumonia, and helping increase access to quality Family Planning services.

Background:

Vector Borne Diseases (VBDs) represent a substantial burden in many low and lower middle-income countries, including India that accounts for a significant proportion of the global burden of Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) and Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL). VL is endemic in about 54 districts in Bihar, Jharkhand, UP and WB with an estimated 130-165 million population at risk whilst LF is more widespread with cases reported across ~20 states/Union Territories and an estimated 550-600 million people at risk. Under the aegis of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Program, significant progress has been made towards elimination by 2025 and this ambitious vision is backed by strong political and robust programmatic strategy. Mass Drug Administration (MDA) for addressing LF has been completed and transmission interruption accomplished in 94 of the 256 endemic districts; however, transmission continues in 137 districts despite ~5-6 rounds of MDA underscoring the challenge of the task ahead.

CHAI is privileged to support NVBDCP’s bold vision of accelerated elimination of VL and LF by 2025. To that end, CHAI plans to staff a Technical Support Unit (TSU), an embedded team to work under the guidance of NVBDCP to achieve its vision through:

About Us
Founded in 2017 and headquartered in Lower Manhattan, Accrete.AI is an artificial intelligence company that builds proprietary dynamic learning technologies called Knowledge Functions designed to boost analytical productivity. Accrete’s Knowledge Functions comprise of latent mathematical representations of tacit human knowledge that seed models that dynamically recalibrate neural architectures on the fly with minimal feedback, resolving issues related to catastrophic forgetting. As a result, Accrete’s Knowledge Functions capture and scale tacit knowledge by enabling machines to accurately understand and adapt to changing contexts. Accrete’s Knowledge Functions are powering domain specific applications that accurately filter self-promotion to identify authentically engaged users; gauge influence to predict viral potential; track the propagation of rumors; and more.
Backed in part by Dr. David Magerman, who helped found the equities trading group at the world leading quantitative hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, Accrete.AI began by building and licensing applications that would help financial analysts predict market-moving merger and acquisition rumors and transcribe and analyze scores of earnings calls simultaneously in real time with human level granularity and accuracy. Accrete has since expanded its stable of Knowledge Functions to build and license smart analytical tools across a variety of industries beyond financial services such as defense, real estate, music and collectibles.
We believe that the way humans conduct analytical work will undergo radical transformation over the next several years. Due to an explosion in digital information and cognitive limitations of the human brain, it is impossible for human analysts to capture the true complexity associated with forecasting future events using pre-defined factors. As such, we specialize in building dynamic, continuously learning models that automate complex cognitive tasks typically performed by human analysts. Our mission at Accrete.AI is to scale human expertise and compound the world's knowledge for the purpose of making accurate predictions about the real world that impact financial markets.
In addition, based in Lower Manhattan, Accrete has a majority interest in NYC based Shinrai, an AI Services subsidiary.

"Architecture, Data, and Analytics Lead","Bengaluru, Karnataka",Citizengage,None,Organic,"You will build the foundation for us to emerge as one India’s leading cognitive computing companies. Whether it is thinking about scaling our architecture, getting your hands dirty with data-crunching or basic code, or finding novel insights for us to apply in creating self-managing communities through smart technology, your KPI will be the reduction in the ratio of human power needed to serve the citizens and businesses in our network. You will be responsible for our infrastructure, data, and algorithm layers. It’s a huge responsibility for the right visionary who has the experience to backup their ideas with rapid delivery.
Required Skills:
Architecture on the Cloud - You have deployed the latest plug-and-play infrastructure products to help rapidly growing startups scale. Evaluating the applicability and appropriateness of these solutions is second nature to you. Navigating the latest and greatest of AWS is child’s play. You have a track record of building stable and scalable back-end infrastructure. .
Security - Cloud and open-source are great but you understand the security and privacy concerns that accompany this wave and have deployed successful solutions to address these. We’re not just talking about just databases.
Data, Data, Data!!! - You live, breathe, and are obsessed with how to capture, store, and utilize data. Your first response to requests for something new are to sketch out diagrams of how the request would integrate with current architecture or what additional layers it would require. You’ve taken ownership of entire data flows in past organizations and are adept at translating ideas into prototypes overnight.
Optimization - A large part of what we do involves improving efficiency under various constraints.You need to be adept at algorithms and foster a deep interest in creating the foundation for cognitive computing and machine learning to thrive.
Team Builder - It’s not just about your individual talents - you’ve developed a team around creating intuitive and addictive user experiences and can channel the potential from young talent toward on-time and amazing products
Still a coder - Ready to get your hands dirty with code and taking responsibility for all aspects of launching new products.
Up for the Challenge - Working on a platform with multiple products is exciting to you and you can handle the multiple deadlines and integration challenges that accompany this style of working.
Startup Growth - You’ve taken products, companies, and teams at mobile and ideally logistics-related startups from Level 3 to Level 10 before and are wise about how to handle growth, when to ditch old code, and prioritize what needs to get done today and what can wait a few more months.
Respect for Experience - You’re not just an engineer who loves to work on the latest and greatest technology. What drives you is the kind of experience your code, architecture, and stack create, the feelings your users experience. You don’t necessarily need to design UI yourself but you should have respect and humility for user capacity and treat is as the key constraint to what we deploy.
Tech stack agnostic - What tools we’re using only matters to you at a level of optimization, efficiency, and future capability. Other than this, you should feel comfortable switching between languages and frameworks with a broad exposure to multiple toolsets. Use of Clojure and other functional programming languages is a bonus.
Nice to have:
Geospatial Data - Experience with geospatial data and interfaces, especially leveraging open source resources.
Supply Chain/Logistics - Track record of building products in the logistics, hyper-local delivery, or supply chain management space with a broad range of users and multiple integrations with external tools, including payment gateways and social media sign-in’s.
Data Visualization - Data visualization expertise and background of simplifying analytics.
Telephony - Integration experience with telephony providers (SMS, IVR, etc.).
Hardware/Sensors - Hardware integration with sensors, mobile add-ons, and other technologies in the Smart Cities space.
Waste Management - Passion for the waste management space and an intuitive understanding of on-ground realities that constrain technology options."

Why Typeset
Academia, Pharma and BioTech Research has the potential to solve humanity’s most pressing problems. The world’s top scientists are working on these problems but they are equipped with archaic tools and the knowledge is stored in unstructured formats (PDF) and published as incomplete narratives. This impedes the speed. It makes discovering, verifying, or building upon scientific information nearly impossible and results in massive economic losses for universities and pharmaceutical companies.
Typeset aspires to solve this problem and increase the impact of the research. We offer an integrated platform for researchers to discover, write, collaborate and publish research.
Typeset has, on average, increased researcher productivity by upto 30 to 50 percent, by automating tasks and reducing duplication.
