The CMM programmer’s responsibility is to ensure the machine is properly working through programming scripts and tests.

The programmer's hours may vary depending on the industry and when the company uses the machine. If the machine is utilized 24 hours a day, the programmer may be assigned the “swing shift” some days and regular shifts on others. Usually, entry-level programmers are assigned the swing shift.

Software Developer,India,Crypto Mize,None,"Software Developer Responsibilities
Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components. Software development is a process of writing and maintaining the source code. Therefore, software development may include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products.
A Software Developer is a person that creates software – either completely, or with other companies or people. The phrase ‘software development’ often means more than just designing or writing the software, it usually means someone who manages the project, or does only the main things. Most software developers are still led by a lead programmer (a software engineer that guides the project).
A Software Developer serves as a member of the software development team. They aid in the innovation and creation of company software and programs. Generally found in tech-heavy industries and large corporations, a Software Developer will work alongside a team of programmers to code programs that meet the need of the company or client. They seek to facilitate the proper design and implementation of software.
Software Developers use software development languages and tools to write, edit, maintain, and test computer software. Software Developers follow the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to plan, design, build, test, and deploy software applications, ranging from websites and mobile applications to web applications and video games. In addition to creating new software, Software Developers improve and maintain the working order of existing software.

JAVA Developer
Software and hardware computer programming development is divided into two functions: the front-end, where users interface the program and the back-end, which is the foundation for the build of any IT program. Back End Developers are coders who work behind the scenes on website functionality so the front end that you view works perfectly. They are the computer programmers that tell the software how to behave. This role stretches across digitized technology and computing, from Android phones to websites to the software that allows you to order concert tickets – and much more.
The Back End Web Developer job is all about the minute detail found in software utilities. The Back End Developer is a source code specialist, at the beginning of a customized website design process, and they are crucial to getting your project off the ground. If you surf a website, you will not see the work of this specialist, but you wouldn’t be able to access the website without their work.
Back End Developers usually focus on three things on the web: a server, which houses data, a software application, and a database. This role helps these technologies all function properly together.

Technical Lead - Standards,"Pune, Maharashtra",Romax Technology Limited,None,"Job Title: Technical Lead – Standards
Department: COE (The Consulting Centre of Excellence (CoE))

The Team
The Romax suite of software is core to our business. Our tools are world leading because they are rooted in the practical engineering work that we do ourselves for customers, either in the Design, Regional Consultancy or Innovation & Research teams. The Consulting Centre of Excellence (CoE) team bridges between Software and these Engineering teams, pulling in real experience and using this to help meet the requirements of our software customers. An understanding of both sides is crucial. CoE contains the Product Design function who are responsible for making the software useable for customers.
Role Description

Working closely with the HQ CCoE team, the Expert Mechanical Engineer would be in charge of maintenance of the Standard capability within Romax. This includes:
Maintaining a record of the standards used in the different parts of the software (open to the rest of Romax staff)
Organising how Romax staff work on Standards committees (i.e. know who is on what committee, when they are meeting, are they actively working on it, do they have access to previews of new standards)
Understanding when these standards are being replaced and the possible changes and repercussions for software development.
Keep Product Management up to date on the current/future status of standards in our areas of interest
Work with the Product Designers within CCoE as they design the UI for parts of the software that use standards (give advice on how the standard works, pitfalls with it, etc.).

For clarity the teams work roughly as follows:
Product Design make the software useful – define what the customers want to do with the standards
This role will specify what mathematics are used to do that in the standards
Developers then code the mathematics

We see the bulk of the role being the following:

Extracting mathematical functions

The role will involve analysing mechanical engineering standards (e.g. AGMA, ISO) and converting them into mathematical functions which computer programmers can implement. The testers will then test that the computer code matches the mathematical functions. The mathematical functions will be maintained in Matlab or similar (e.g. Octave). Note, aside from creating the functions in Matlab, the role does not involve any computer programming.

Interpreting the Standards

The developers and testers will have questions about the technical implementation of the Standard, and part of the role will be to act as the single point of contact for the developers and testers with regard to the correct technical implementation of the Standard. In some cases the Standard will not be precise enough, or may even be wrong, and the role will involve taking a decision on how to implement (i.e. interpreting the Standard is not the responsibility of the developer, but may be shared with the product designer who is concerned with software usability)

Maintaining a dictionary of terms

Different Standards use different terms for the same thing; one responsibility of the role will be to maintain an internal dictionary of terms which is consistent for the developers, and map those terms to the different Standards. In other words, there will be a “Romax” dictionary of terms which is consistent in the computer code across all Romax implementations of the Standards. The terms that are used in the user interface is another matter and will be determined as part of the requirements on a case by case basis.

Requirements for the role

Extreme attention to detail, highly organised
Ability to express mathematical functions in Matlab (or similar)
Sufficient experience/knowledge to be able to understand and interpret mechanical engineering Standards
Excellent team working & ability to discuss/explain complex topics over the phone

Essential:

Software Developer,India,Crypto Mize,None,"Software Developer Responsibilities
Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components. Software development is a process of writing and maintaining the source code. Therefore, software development may include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products.
A Software Developer is a person that creates software – either completely, or with other companies or people. The phrase ‘software development’ often means more than just designing or writing the software, it usually means someone who manages the project, or does only the main things. Most software developers are still led by a lead programmer (a software engineer that guides the project).
A Software Developer serves as a member of the software development team. They aid in the innovation and creation of company software and programs. Generally found in tech-heavy industries and large corporations, a Software Developer will work alongside a team of programmers to code programs that meet the need of the company or client. They seek to facilitate the proper design and implementation of software.
Software Developers use software development languages and tools to write, edit, maintain, and test computer software. Software Developers follow the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to plan, design, build, test, and deploy software applications, ranging from websites and mobile applications to web applications and video games. In addition to creating new software, Software Developers improve and maintain the working order of existing software.
