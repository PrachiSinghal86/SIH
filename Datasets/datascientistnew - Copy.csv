“Do you want to make a major impact in next 1 year?”
“Do you want to build new products from scratch?”
“Do you like startup culture?”

If yes, then this might be right opportunity for you.

We are Lockers team! We solve the problem of package delivery to customers. A lot of time Amazon customers have to go through hassles of coordinating delivery time with carriers and are not able to receive their packages. We solve this problem for them. We allow customer to get their package (and do their returns) when and where they want. In other words, we make the package delivery asynchronous in nature. Is that an important problem? Draw a comparison with how messaging solutions like AWS SQS / JMS are critical part of tech architecture, the same way we are becoming important to package delivery.

We have been in existence for last 8 years, have a network of 10K lockers in 12+ countries, and deliver millions of package a month. However, we still call ourselves a startup. This is because of how we operate and how we are scaling. We have our key stakeholders and dependencies under single leadership. We take quick decision and move fast on them. In last 3 years, we have launched 2 brand new successful products. This year, we have started working on a new product which will transform the way we look at lockers. We plan to create lockers which will run without any internet and power connections for years. These lockers will be installed at public places with ease and made discover-able to customers in real-time. This will allow us to scale 10x in next 3 years (which is what we have signed-up for!)

In this role, you will get breadth & depth of experience. Our org will build package pickup capability in MShop (biggest shopping app in the World), package delivery capabilities in Rabbit (one of the biggest Carrier App), maintenance capabilities in our own Administrator App, firmware in cutting edge technologies like RUST and multiple backend highly scalable services using native AWS technologies; most of it to be built from scratch. The team will we be working with multiple partners from vendors in China to Lab126 in SFO. As part of this team, you will see all these things coming together under the same roof and will see it making a major impact in next 1 year!

You will lead and coordinate design/implementation efforts, coordinating across multiple teams to develop optimal solutions. You will be expected to create a roadmap, align with business partners on prioritization, propose appropriate tradeoffs, clearly communicate goals, roles, responsibilities, and desired outcomes to leadership and stakeholders. You will also establish planning mechanisms to deliver on your roadmap, demonstrate strong operational excellence and maintain a high code quality bar. You will be expected to deep dive into complex business use cases and system dependencies and work backwards from the customer to propose solutions that solve business and customer needs.

SDE-2s provide technical leadership at Amazon. They help establish technical standards and drive Amazon’s overall technical architecture, engineering practices, and methodologies. They work on our hard problems, building high quality, architecturally sound systems that are aligned with our business needs. They think globally when building systems, ensuring Amazon builds high performing, scalable systems that work well together. They are hands on, producing both detailed technical work and high-level designs.

Experience building highly scalable, high availability services
Experience in real-time analytical systems and machine learning
Experience dealing with performance, memory and I/O

The ideal candidate will be a visionary leader, builder and operator. He/she should have experience leading or contributing to multiple simultaneous product development efforts and initiatives. He/she needs to balance technical leadership with strong business judgment to make the right decisions about technology choices. He/she needs to be constantly striving for simplicity, and at the same time demonstrate significant creativity, innovation and judgment.",

Linux System Administrator,"Bengaluru, Karnataka",vepsun technologies,"₹25,000 - ₹35,000 a month",Organic,"Linux Administrator Job Description
Linux administrators are back-end IT specialists who install, configure, and maintain Linux operating systems in a variety of organizations. This role involves server-side operations and troubleshooting tasks that support business-critical and development activities. Linux administrators also configure user access and monitor system stability and security through deployment and everyday use.
This role requires extensive familiarity with Linux systems and servers and may involve a high level of risk assessment and user support. Because Linux is an open-source operating system, administrators also frequently communicate and collaborate with other developers to develop and implement system enhancements.
Linux Administrator Duties and ResponsibilitiesWhile the specific duties of a Linux administrator can vary based on their business and industry, the general responsibilities of this role are relatively consistent. Based on listings that we analyzed, these duties include:
Install and Configure Linux Systems
A Linux administrator’s main responsibility is to install and set up Linux systems and servers, often for organization-wide deployment. They develop servers and work with individual users to ensure that the system works reliably and quickly and answer questions related to setup and installation. In this role, Linux administrators also set up the architecture of the system, including back-end databases and scripts for specific applications and use cases.
Perform System Maintenance
Linux administrators also perform routine system maintenance and resolve server-side issues as they arise. This aspect of the role requires the Linux administrator to review error logs and reported errors and seek out solutions. Frequently, Linux administrators need to work directly with the system’s source code to make necessary changes to ensure reliable performance and then deploy those changes throughout the system.
Create System Backups
Linux administrators also conduct system backups according to company or industry standards. They may perform these backups weekly, daily, or more frequently depending on system space and business needs. This improves system recovery after a crash or other outage and supports data integrity by ensuring that there is never a massive loss of vital information.
Monitor System Performance
In addition to maintaining Linux systems and servers, Linux administrators also monitor system performance to prevent slowdowns and crashes. They may examine daily traffic logs and reports or receive direct reports from end users. If the Linux administrator notices potential issues or recurring problems within the system, they develop and deploy solutions so that the system remains usable for all personnel.
Provide Technical Support and Guidance
Linux administrators provide technical support and guidance to users and other administrators. In many cases, the Linux administrator works closely with other developers to answer technical questions or resolve issues with server-side performance. They may also support users by assisting with installation and maintenance of Linux-based programs and help debug these applications so that they work with existing servers.
Maintain System Security
Finally, Linux administrators maintain system security by actively identifying faults and vulnerable areas within the system’s architecture. This part of the job requires extensive knowledge of viruses and other sources of system vulnerability, and requires the Linux administrator to proactively develop protections, particularly when deploying system-wide changes that can open up new vulnerabilities.
