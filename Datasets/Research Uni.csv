Marketing research is the process that links the producers, customers, and end users to the marketer through information used to identify and define marketing opportunities and problems. Marketing research specifies the information required to address these issues, designs the method for collecting information, manages and implements the data collection process, analyses the results, and communicates the findings and their implications.
Marketing research is the systematic gathering, recording, and analysis of qualitative and quantitative data about issues relating to marketing products and services. The goal of marketing research is to identify and assess how changing elements of the marketing mix impacts customer behaviour.

Through all of these analyses, the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of a company can be identified. Finally, with the help of a SWOT analysis, adequate business strategies of a company will be defined.
Market Research Analysts are marketing specialists who help determine an organization’s position in the marketplace in order to effectively promote their products and services. They research competitors and their marketing methods, and study and gather consumer information.

"Analyst, Cancer","Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh",Clinton Health Access Initiative,None,"Overview:
The Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc. (CHAI) is a global health organization committed to saving lives and reducing the burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, while strengthening the capabilities of governments and the private sector in those countries to create and sustain high-quality health systems that can succeed without our assistance. For more information, please visit: http://www.clintonhealthaccess.org

CHAI in partnership with its India affiliate William J Clinton Foundation (WJCF), works in close partnership with and under the guidance of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) at the Central and States’ levels on an array of high priority initiatives aimed at improving health outcomes. Currently CHAI/WJCF works across projects to expand access to quality care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis-C, tuberculosis, cancer and immunization.

Additionally, CHAI/WJCF is also supporting the government of Madhya Pradesh (MP) on large-scale programs to arrest childhood and maternal mortality due to malnutrition, anaemia, diarrhoea and pneumonia, and helping increase access to quality Family Planning services.

Cancer Program:

With over a million new cancer cases and ~680,000 cancer deaths, the Mortality Incidence Ratio (MIR) in India at 67% is far above many other countries (e.g. the US has a MIR of 38%); hundreds of thousands of lives could be saved if this gap is narrowed. Cervical cancer is the second leading type of cancer (by incidence and mortality) amongst women. However, there exist significant possibilities to prevent this cancer through secondary interventions focused on screening and treatment of pre-cancerous lesions. Towards this, CHAI/WJCF has initiated a program with the objective of “Preventing deaths from cervical cancer by catalyzing the use of optimal screening tests and treatment devices” which seeks to build systems and capacities and mobilize communities for cervical cancer screening, augment available treatment capacity – including infusion of optimal treatment devices and build and strengthen reporting and referral structures towards ensuring improved access to services.

The program is currently being implemented in the state of Madhya Pradesh where we are engaging with the state government to:
Ensure readiness of facilities for cervical cancer screening
Strengthen capacity to deliver screening and treatment services
Augment available capacity for treatment of pre-cancerous lesions
Strengthen reporting and referral mechanisms to improve access to care
Create community level awareness with the objective of mobilizing beneficiaries for screening
CHAI/WJCF intends to leverage learnings from the program to inform discourse and policy on cervical cancer and support scale-up of such initiatives across the country.

We are seeking a highly motivated, results-oriented individual with strong quantitative and analytical skills to support with the strategizing and implementation of cervical cancer initiative in Madhya Pradesh. Candidates must have excellent problem-solving ability, communication and writing skills, be able to function independently, and have a strong commitment to excellence.
Responsibilities:
Provide strategic and analytical support to program work streams and identify high impact areas of intervention in cervical cancer screening, diagnostics and treatment
Monitor program implementation activities, including but not limited to, working with and engaging with field staff to review programmatic activities, track implementation of activities, and monitor and review outputs
Identify potential risks and challenges to the implementation plan and roll-out of activities; work towards addressing potential risks / mitigation mechanisms
Support development of proposals, work plans, budgets and other reports and documents for ongoing and new areas
Develop strong working relationships with and represent CHAI/WJCF as trust advisor to key stakeholders in government, international partners, donors, suppliers and NGOs, and ensure maximum coordination of resources and effort
Develop and maintain up-to-date expertise on cancer treatment and diagnosis, supplier landscape, regulatory issues, treatment guidelines and market intelligence through rigorous research
Support program management and leadership team with programmatic activities as required

About The Team
We’re about 40 of us across three locations working hard to make sure we’re always ahead of the game. At Spuul, it’s never ‘just a job’ and life doesn’t end at 5 pm.

Our CEO walks into office with his collars turned up, and you’re free to come dressed in a three piece suit if you please!

"Analyst, Supply Chain, Diagnostics","New Delhi, Delhi",Clinton Health Access Initiative,None,"Overview:
The Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc. (CHAI) is a global health organization committed to saving lives and reducing the burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, while strengthening the capabilities of governments and the private sector in those countries to create and sustain high-quality health systems that can succeed without our assistance.

CHAI in partnership with its India affiliate William J Clinton Foundation (WJCF), works in close partnership with and under the guidance of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) at the Central and States’ levels on an array of high priority initiatives aimed at improving health outcomes. Currently CHAI works across projects to expand access to quality care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis-C, tuberculosis, cancer and immunization.

Background

The world has not experienced a pandemic at the scale or pace of the current COVID-19 pandemic; the virus has ferociously attacked high- and low-income countries alike, but in so doing has exposed inequities in access to quality care within and across countries. Despite a proactive mitigation and stringent suppression strategy, the number of COVID cases in India continues to rise. While the indirect impacts of the COVID-19 on availability and utilization of routine health services cannot yet be known, lessons from previous crises suggest that service disruption and displacement will have grave impact on population health. In order to address these challenges, a robust response based on strengthened health workforce, resilient supply chains and rapid increase in diagnostic capacity is being spearheaded by the Ministry of Health and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

"Analyst, Insights, Routine Immunization Access, Uttar Prades...","Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh",Clinton Health Access Initiative,None,"Overview:
The Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc. (CHAI) is a global health organization committed to saving lives and reducing the burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, while strengthening the capabilities of governments and the private sector in those countries to create and sustain high-quality health systems that can succeed without our assistance. For more information, please visit: http://www.clintonhealthaccess.org

Background:

Through the prioritized implementation of high impact public health interventions like immunization, access to safe drinking water, improved neo-natal and infant care and access to effective treatment for pneumonia and diarrhea, India has reduced its infant mortality rate (IMR) from 89 in 1990 to 32 in 2017 and Under-five Mortality Rate (U5MR) from 126 in 1990 to 39 in 2017[1]. India’s Universal Immunization Program (UIP) is one of the largest public immunization programs in the world. It caters to 26.3 million infants and 30 million pregnant women annually through 9 million planned sessions. The program provides access to vaccines against 11 Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs)[2] at the national level and against two VPDs vaccines at the sub-national level[3].
Under the strong leadership of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW) and state governments, the entire immunization ecosystem has demonstrated proactive commitment for achieving universal immunization coverage in the country in recent years. Strategic projects in this direction include but are not limited to introduction of new vaccines[4], rolling out of data systems[5], strengthening of national immunization centres such as Immunization Technical Support Unit (ITSU) and National Cold Chain & Vaccines Management Resource Centre (NCCVMRC) and successful piloting of initiatives for bolstering health worker capacity building[6]. Coupled with these initiatives, MoHFW launched Mission Indradhanush (MI) in 2014 and Intensified Mission Indradhanush (iMI) in 2017: catch up and system strengthening campaigns to target underserved, vulnerable, resistant, and inaccessible populations. iMI has resulted in an increase of 6.7% in full immunization coverage (FIC) after the first two phases in prioritized districts[7]. However, the government and partners recognize the need for further efforts in this direction to reduce the 802,000 infant deaths and 989,000 under-five deaths that occur annually in the country[8].

Uttar Pradesh (UP), the most populous state of India, contributes more than 20% (5.7 million) to India’s annual birth cohort. UP has the highest infant mortality (64 deaths per 1,000 live births) and under five mortality rates (78 death per 1,000 live births) in the country[9]. UP’s FIC went up from 51.1% in 2015-16, to 65.3% in 2018 through concentrated efforts and catch up campaigns (MI and iMI) in 60 out of 75 districts. However, wide variations in coverage exist across regional and social categories. In 2018, UP accounted for 25% of under-immunized children in India & 9.5% of world’s under-immunized children. Improvements in UP’s FIC are essential to national and global improvements in immunization coverage, as an increase in UP’s FIC from 65 to 90% could increase India’s FIC by 6 percentage points, and the global FIC by 1%. The government of Uttar Pradesh (GoUP) is currently rapidly implementing a new strategic roadmap for holistic improvement of immunization outcomes in the state.

Program Overview:

CHAI operates an immunization program in India to support the MoHFW’s UIP at the national level and in the focus states of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. CHAI provides catalytic support to the NCCVMRC, which is based out of National Institute of Health and Family Welfare (NIHFW), on national projects for improving availability and efficacy of vaccines and efficiency of vaccines systems by strengthening cold chain management and vaccines delivery & logistics. CHAI also supports national and state governments on broader operational aspects such as planning, capacity building and systems improvements for immunization service delivery. Supporting GoUP since 2013, the Uttar Pradesh Technical Support Unit (UP-TSU) works closely with the Department of Health & Family Welfare and the Department of Child Welfare of GoUP to improve the availability, quality and utilization of critical reproductive, maternal, natal, child and adolescent health (RMNCH+A) interventions and services and has a deep understanding of UP’s health systems, geography and demographics and opportunities.

Recognizing the vision and ambition of the GoUP on improving immunization coverage and equity outcomes in the state, CHAI and UP-TSU are undertaking a transformative project to provide support to GoUP at the state and district levels and in prioritized blocks. A purposely-formulated immunization project management unit (PMU) nestled within the UP-TSU will anchor this support to GoUP. The PMU will design and deploy catalytic support to GoUP based on the guiding principles of impact, integration, investment, and innovation. The PMU will support GoUP on the state’s plans for strengthening evidence-informed decision-making, enhancing state capacity to manage and govern immunization service delivery and augmenting immunization systems in prioritized blocks of the state.

Role Overview:

CHAI is seeking a highly motivated individual with outstanding credentials and demonstrated analytical abilities for the role of Insights Analyst. The Analyst will report to the Strategy & Insights manager within the Immunization PMU. The Analyst would be required to assimilate a variety of data points that include the various centralized databases that exist such as the Health Management Information System (HMIS), UP Health Dashboard, UP-HMIS, Reproductive Child Health (RCH) portal, eVIN, NCCMIS to name few that are operational within the Immunization ecosystem between Government and stakeholders. The Analyst would bring all the data sets together and scientifically represent insights to enable informed decision making. The Analyst would play a key role in developing and socializing easy to use automated tools and templates, aimed at making immunization service delivery & program management more effective. The ideal candidate should have strong problem solving and communication abilities, be able to work independently, be flexible, and have a strong commitment to excellence. CHAI places great value on relevant personal qualities: resourcefulness, responsibility, tenacity, independence, energy, and work ethic.

"Analyst, Nutrition, India","Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh",Clinton Health Access Initiative,"₹6,210 a month","Overview:
The Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc. (CHAI) is a global health organization committed to saving lives and reducing the burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, while strengthening the capabilities of governments and the private sector in those countries to create and sustain high-quality health systems that can succeed without our assistance. For more information, please visit: http://www.clintonhealthaccess.org

CHAI has been working in India since 2004 in close partnership with and under the guidance of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) at the Central and States’ levels on an array of high priority initiatives aimed at improving health outcomes. Currently CHAI works across projects to expand access to quality care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis-C, tuberculosis, cancer and immunisation. Additionally, CHAI is also supporting the government of Madhya Pradesh (MP) on large-scale programs to arrest childhood and maternal mortality due to malnutrition, anaemia, diarrhoea and pneumonia, and helping increase access to quality family planning services

Dietary Diversity in Nutrition Program
Since 2016, with the support of the IKEA Foundation, CHAI has been working to reduce the prevalence of malnutrition amongst young children and anaemia amongst women of reproductive age group in Madhya Pradesh. To that end, CHAI has developed a comprehensive strategy that aims to address supply and demand side infirmities in public funded services to improve the nutritional status of marginalised communities in the state. CHAI has had great success over the last few years in assisting the Government of Madhya Pradesh (GoMP) to introduce transformational reforms. To note a few, the GoMP has introduced a wholly nutritious complementary food for ~3 million children and ~2 million pregnant women and has accelerated the introduction of an improved iron folic acid (IFA) formulation with an assured delivery mechanism to every village.

While improving efficiencies of Government’s health and nutrition related services is critical to improving nutrition outcomes in the communities, CHAI is cognizant that a large aspect of community nutrition is tied directly with the quality and quantity of locally available food and the ability of households to include these in their daily diet. Unfortunately, due to the prevailing low income levels (average monthly income INR 6,210 or USD 88[1]) marginalised families find it difficult to consume a diverse diet; out of 41% of calorie intake of rural households in MP comes from non-cereals, only 7%[2] comes from consumption of fruits, vegetables, meat, eggs and fish thereby unable to fulfil their nutrient requirements on daily basis. It’s also noteworthy that while approximately 55%[3] of a household’s income in the state is dedicated to procuring food items, most communities continue to consume a staple heavy diet as it’s both easier and cheaper to access. This trend is particularly ironic since more than 60% of the rural community in MP is agrarian and derives at least 40-50% their income from selling agricultural produce. Approximately 65%[4] of farmers in the State fall in the small or marginalised category but only make about ~INR 37,260/year or USD 532/year from core agricultural activities. Small farmers are not able to generate adequate and predictable income because of several compounding factors including inefficient market structures, unreliable quality of their produce, varying yield from their landholdings and low crop intensity which makes them heavily reliant on a single variety of crop.

CHAI intends to collaborate with the GoMP to introduce a set of comprehensive interventions to significantly improve the food diversity among the small and marginal segment of farmers in order to improve the nutritional status- this is largely possible by diversifying the agricultural practices and enhancing the income levels in long term. At this point, CHAI expects to pilot an approach (support provided as technical assistance) with limited geographical scope along with state rural livelihoods mission. The pilot will bring together a comprehensive set of interventions with women self-help groups to adopt various package of practices suitable and enhance community’s nutritional uptake.
The program is looking for an Analyst who can manage the responsibilities and work closely with the Program Manager on project strategy and execution. The role entails working with an entrepreneurial mind-set and self-motivation. A highly qualified, dynamic, energetic person with exceptional people skills and experience of working in challenging environments would make for a strong candidate for this role. Demonstrated application of analytical skills and problem solving in complex environments would be essential. Previous exposure to strategy projects and working on outputs for senior leadership, especially with the government, would help bolster the application.

"Analyst, Program Analysis, Routine Immunization Access, Utta...","Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh",Clinton Health Access Initiative,None,"Overview:
The Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc. (CHAI) is a global health organization committed to saving lives and reducing the burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, while strengthening the capabilities of governments and the private sector in those countries to create and sustain high-quality health systems that can succeed without our assistance. For more information, please visit: http://www.clintonhealthaccess.org

Background:

Through the prioritized implementation of high impact public health interventions like immunization, access to safe drinking water, improved neo-natal and infant care and access to effective treatment for pneumonia and diarrhea, India has reduced its infant mortality rate (IMR) from 89 in 1990 to 32 in 2017 and Under-five Mortality Rate (U5MR) from 126 in 1990 to 39 in 2017[1]. India’s Universal Immunization Program (UIP) is one of the largest public immunization programs in the world. It caters to 26.3 million infants and 30 million pregnant women annually through 9 million planned sessions. The program provides access to vaccines against 11 Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs)[2] at the national level and against two VPDs vaccines at the sub-national level[3].

Under the strong leadership of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW) and state governments, the entire immunization ecosystem has demonstrated proactive commitment for achieving universal immunization coverage in the country in recent years. Strategic projects in this direction include but are not limited to introduction of new vaccines[4], rolling out of data systems[5], strengthening of national immunization centres such as Immunization Technical Support Unit (ITSU) and National Cold Chain & Vaccines Management Resource Centre (NCCVMRC) and successful piloting of initiatives for bolstering health worker capacity building[6]. Coupled with these initiatives, MoHFW launched Mission Indradhanush (MI) in 2014 and Intensified Mission Indradhanush (iMI) in 2017: catch up and system strengthening campaigns to target underserved, vulnerable, resistant, and inaccessible populations. iMI has resulted in an increase of 6.7% in full immunization coverage (FIC) after the first two phases in prioritized districts[7]. However, the government and partners recognize the need for further efforts in this direction to reduce the 802,000 infant deaths and 989,000 under-five deaths that occur annually in the country[8].

Uttar Pradesh (UP), the most populous state of India, contributes more than 20% (5.7 million) to India’s annual birth cohort. UP has the highest infant mortality (64 deaths per 1,000 live births) and under five mortality rates (78 death per 1,000 live births) in the country[9]. UP’s FIC went up from 51.1% in 2015-16, to 65.3% in 2018 through concentrated efforts and catch up campaigns (MI and iMI) in 60 out of 75 districts. However, wide variations in coverage exist across regional and social categories. In 2018, UP accounted for 25% of under-immunized children in India & 9.5% of world’s under-immunized children. Improvements in UP’s FIC are essential to national and global improvements in immunization coverage, as an increase in UP’s FIC from 65 to 90% could increase India’s FIC by 6 percentage points, and the global FIC by 1%. The government of Uttar Pradesh (GoUP) is currently rapidly implementing a new strategic roadmap for holistic improvement of immunization outcomes in the state.

Program Overview:

CHAI operates an immunization program in India to support the MoHFW’s UIP at the national level and in the focus states of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. CHAI provides catalytic support to the NCCVMRC, which is based out of National Institute of Health and Family Welfare (NIHFW), on national projects for improving availability and efficacy of vaccines and efficiency of vaccines systems by strengthening cold chain management and vaccines delivery & logistics. CHAI also supports national and state governments on broader operational aspects such as planning, capacity building and systems improvements for immunization service delivery. Supporting GoUP since 2013, the Uttar Pradesh Technical Support Unit (UP-TSU) works closely with the Department of Health & Family Welfare and the Department of Child Welfare of GoUP to improve the availability, quality and utilization of critical reproductive, maternal, natal, child and adolescent health (RMNCH+A) interventions and services and has a deep understanding of UP’s health systems, geography and demographics and opportunities.

Recognizing the vision and ambition of the GoUP on improving immunization coverage and equity outcomes in the state, CHAI and UP-TSU are undertaking a transformative project to provide support to GoUP at the state and district levels and in prioritized blocks. A purposely-formulated immunization project management unit (PMU) nestled within the UP-TSU will anchor this support to GoUP. The PMU will design and deploy catalytic support to GoUP based on the guiding principles of impact, integration, investment, and innovation. The PMU will support GoUP on the state’s plans for strengthening evidence-informed decision-making, enhancing state capacity to manage and govern immunization service delivery and augmenting immunization systems in prioritized blocks of the state.

Role Overview:

CHAI is seeking a highly motivated individual with outstanding credentials and demonstrated analytical and stakeholder management abilities for the role of Immunization Program Analyst. The Analyst will report to the Strategy & Insights manager within the Immunization PMU. The Analyst will work very closely with GoUP's Routine Immunization (RI) cell and will provide continuous analytical & programmatic support to the immunization leadership in the state. The Analyst would deliver critical and on-demand program insights by leveraging multiple immunization & public health databases and field insights. The Analyst would support the RI cell in creating, executing and monitoring short term and long-term coverage improvement plans. The ideal candidate should have exceptional interpersonal skills, be able to work independently, be flexible, and have a strong commitment to excellence. CHAI places great value on relevant personal qualities: resourcefulness, responsibility, tenacity, independence, energy, and work ethic.

"Analyst-Technical, Oxygen","Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh",Clinton Health Access Initiative,None,"Overview:
The Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc. (CHAI) is a global health organization committed to saving lives and reducing the burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, while strengthening the capabilities of governments and the private sector in those countries to create and sustain high-quality health systems that can succeed without our assistance. For more information, please visit: http://www.clintonhealthaccess.org

CHAI has been working in India since 2004 under the guidance of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) at the Central and States’ levels on an array of high priority initiatives aimed at improving health outcomes. Currently CHAI works across projects to expand access to quality care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis-C, tuberculosis, cancer, sexual and reproductive health and immunisation.

Additionally, CHAI is supporting the government of Madhya Pradesh (MP) on large-scale programs to arrest childhood and maternal mortality due to malnutrition, anemia, diarrhea and pneumonia, and helping increase access to quality Family Planning services.

Background on Essential Medicines Program:

Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) had launched an effort to scale-up access to treatment for Pneumonia & Diarrhea, which combined, kills over 1.5 million children every year. Working with the governments of five-high-burden countries (India, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia and Nigeria) and leading global institutions, CHAI is supporting intensified efforts at both global and country levels to plan, resource, and implement effective interventions for scaling-up access to treatment for these conditions. This is achieved by supporting Governments’ effort in improving access to oxygen and anti-biotics for pneumonia, and, zinc and ORS for diarrhea.

In India, CHAI, in partnership with its affiliate William J Clinton Foundation, is building on its work on supporting efforts to reduce mortality among children below 5 years of age in Madhya Pradesh (MP), which accounts for approximately one eighth of total pneumonia mortality in the country.[1] Appropriate pneumonia treatment and care is constrained by primary dependence in rural areas on informal providers, who lack appropriate training and knowledge as also supply chain inefficiencies that hamper availability of essential medicines and commodities. Further, knowledge and skills gaps at mid-tier public health facilities lead to inconsistent and inaccurate pneumonia classification and higher burden on higher level healthcare facilities.

To overcome these challenges, CHAI/WJCF has been working with government to draft a comprehensive strategy to significantly improve treatment and care and, therefore, outcomes for children suffering from pneumonia. To that end, the program imparts skill-based training for providers at public health facilities, supports measures to improve quantification, procurement and distribution of essential medicines, helps mentor staff at various aspects of oxygen administration and supports improvements in availability of pulse-oximeters for increased hypoxemia screening. At the national level, the program has supported efforts in launching the revised Pneumonia Operational Guidelines and has supported the “Social Awareness and Action plan to Neutralise Pneumonia from Society” (SAANS) campaign to intensify action for reducing mortality due to childhood pneumonia.

Position:

The Essential Medicines Program is looking for a highly motivated professional for the position of Analyst who will work closely with the Program Manager on project strategy and support the program with medical oxygen related expertise. The candidate must be able to function independently, be flexible and entrepreneurial, and have strong commitment to excellence.

About Us
Founded in 2017 and headquartered in Lower Manhattan, Accrete.AI is an artificial intelligence company that builds proprietary dynamic learning technologies called Knowledge Functions designed to boost analytical productivity. Accrete’s Knowledge Functions comprise of latent mathematical representations of tacit human knowledge that seed models that dynamically recalibrate neural architectures on the fly with minimal feedback, resolving issues related to catastrophic forgetting. As a result, Accrete’s Knowledge Functions capture and scale tacit knowledge by enabling machines to accurately understand and adapt to changing contexts. Accrete’s Knowledge Functions are powering domain specific applications that accurately filter self-promotion to identify authentically engaged users; gauge influence to predict viral potential; track the propagation of rumors; and more.
Backed in part by Dr. David Magerman, who helped found the equities trading group at the world leading quantitative hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, Accrete.AI began by building and licensing applications that would help financial analysts predict market-moving merger and acquisition rumors and transcribe and analyze scores of earnings calls simultaneously in real time with human level granularity and accuracy. Accrete has since expanded its stable of Knowledge Functions to build and license smart analytical tools across a variety of industries beyond financial services such as defense, real estate, music and collectibles.
We believe that the way humans conduct analytical work will undergo radical transformation over the next several years. Due to an explosion in digital information and cognitive limitations of the human brain, it is impossible for human analysts to capture the true complexity associated with forecasting future events using pre-defined factors. As such, we specialize in building dynamic, continuously learning models that automate complex cognitive tasks typically performed by human analysts. Our mission at Accrete.AI is to scale human expertise and compound the world's knowledge for the purpose of making accurate predictions about the real world that impact financial markets.
In addition, based in Lower Manhattan, Accrete has a majority interest in NYC based Shinrai, an AI Services subsidiary.

About ShadowMap

ShadowMap is a new product offering developed by Security Brigade with the goal of ensuring that an organization is never surprised by the applications and services exposed. Most organizations today are breaching the traditional perimeter and using a combination of mobile, private/public cloud, co-location services. As such we have found that most organizations are not fully aware of the various applications and services they are exposing. As an attacker, such exposures provide low hanging fruit to target and use as an entry point to compromise the organization.

Our ShadowMap product uses our proprietary process to scan all 4 billion IP addresses in the world every single day and maintain a current database of all publicly exposed applications around the world. In-addition to this, it uses a 20 step the process to further identify even more exposures, classify risks and present a realistic image of the organization's application and service exposures. Typically our ShadowMap product is able to identify all domains, IP ranges, subdomains used by an organization. It further detects all exposed applications and categorizes them by functionality and risk.
