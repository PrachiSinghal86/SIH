The Job Title: Industrial Engineer | Operations Research | Convert Jobs Into Micro Tasks
Type of Position: Full Time, Remote Working from your home
Joining Date: Immediately
Job Description: Can you use your Industrial Engineering or OR skills to convert traditional tasks into Micro Tasks to either automate or outsource? And that too in the service sector?
With the help of your Automation, Vendor Development and Human Resource colleagues you could be managing 100s of Micro Task Outsourcees [MTOs].
Varal is setting up a business to automatically process applications to government agencies, company incorporation jurisdictions, banks, investment trading companies, licensing departments, visa authorities, insurance companies and so on.
To facilitate this automatic processing of applications, you will be required to convert all traditional tasks into the smallest possible reusable micro ones to either have them automated or to have them done manually.
These micro manual tasks must be simple enough to require less than 15 min of training. If the task is micro enough, it will cost only a few cents to do. And should be done online as far as possible.
These tasks will be generated from the assembly line designs of business processes for the processing of applications to institutions e.g. Company registration jurisdictions, banks, investment firms, visa authorities, internal business processes.
Varal already outsources micro tasks. These micro tasks are part of a sequence of tasks, meaning that the result of one may be a predecessor to the next one.
Your job will be to receive the requirements and break up the tasks into micro tasks [MT]. Even skilled jobs must be broken up into micro tasks, till they can be done easily without training the MTO.
To maintain accuracy triangular checks are to be applied to all tasks before their outputs are accepted. Compliances will be built into the process, and these must also be deconstructed into micro tasks to apply them to different fields or task stations.
The job of converting compliances into logic for automation is also a process that will require micro tasks to be outsourced and comes under your purview.
Your creativity and industrial engineering knowledge is essential to keep coming up with solutions that work. Keep trying new methods and finding new ways to make sure the micro tasks are being completed quickly and accurately.
You will interact with the assembly line, HR and automation team. Your job is critical to the launch of Varal 4.0 and will involve: creating the micro tasks, work with HR to recruit the outsourcees, work with the automation team to deliver the job, monitor how it is going, see if the people you assigned the MTs to are delivering. If not change them, or redesign the task or the pricing.
The MTO recruitment ads must be easy to understand. The instructions on how the MTOs are to do their jobs should be unambiguous so that the jobs can be done without human intervention.
You will be the 1st person to be hired to do this job independently. So far we have tested this method successfully and are now ready to scale up.
Who Should Apply?
Are you excited about applying your industrial engineering knowledge to building an unusual service sector company? And then seeing it get automated?
Do you want to be part of building something you will treasure?
Do you have a clear understanding of how to break up jobs into micro ones? Will you feel comfortable with hiring and firing outsourcees to do micro tasks that require payments of a few cents but in large quantities? Can you keep track of them in large numbers?
You will be working with a cross functional team to understand how each job is interrelated with other activities on the assembly line and deliver it.
Do you have a bias for action?
If yes, then take this opportunity and apply.
Education: Industrial Engineering, Operation Research
Experience: 2 - 5 years in any of the above areas with a willingness to apply your knowledge in a slightly different environment
Total Compensation: INR 25,000 to 30,000 / mth
What will your day-to-day look like?
You will be using specific cloud based platforms to do your assigned job.
Learning of new platforms or initiatives. Keeping databases of all Vendor documents and contact persons.
Be fully conversant with Varal’s Values and it’s strategic Thirteen Key Initiatives [TKIs]
Getting to know other team members. Keeping track of your tasks on Trello. Being visible on Slack, Trella, MyVaral. Use of G Suite.
Working with automation, operations, assembly line and micro task teams to automate data collection and work processes in your area.
Keeping close track of your tasks and implementing them instead of second guessing the tasks or procrastinating.

At Cisco, each person brings their different talents to work as a team and make a difference.
Yes, our technology changes the way the world works, lives, plays and learns, but our edge comes from our people.
We connect everything – people, process, data and things – and we use those connections to change our world for the better.
We innovate everywhere - From launching a new era of networking that adapts, learns and protects, to building Cisco Services that accelerate businesses and business results. Our technology powers entertainment, retail, healthcare, education and more – from Smart Cities to your everyday devices.
We benefit everyone - We do all of this while striving for a culture that empowers every person to be the difference, at work and in our communities.
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
