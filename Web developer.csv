Do you want to be part of a global movement for improving the quality of lives for people and significantly enhance your own life in the process?
Are you tired of dead-end jobs with even more “dead” (or constipated) people around yourself and you seek to make your life, your career and yourself matter?

Idex is not a place for those who are happy with the status-quo. Its only fit for those with ambitions. Ambitions for a great life for themselves and for making a difference in the world.
And while we are situated in the rather dull and boring city of Jaipur in India, our fan-base is global. And so are our ambitions.
We are committed to and making strong progress towards our 20-year goal to serve 5 million people annually and get there by continuously challenging ourselves for creating innovative service solutions, providing great value to our customers, elevating lives of our stakeholders, disrupting already existing ways of doing things and making an impact globally.
