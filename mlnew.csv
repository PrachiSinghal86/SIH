Deep Learning Engineer - Platform and Infrastructure,"Bengaluru, Karnataka",Drishti Technologies,None,"Join Drishti to solve a 100-year-old problem for a $12 trillion dollar industry.
Deep learning-driven action recognition is the next frontier for AI. Build it with us.

Drishti’s mission is to “extend human potential in an increasingly automated world”. For the first time since Henry Ford, we’re making manual processes visible to factory analytics—by creating manufacturing’s first and only solution for deep learning-driven action recognition.

About this role

In this role, you will be breaking ground by partnering with some of the world’s most advanced deep learning and computer vision engineers. Your job will be to build and maintain large-scale systems to support the entire pipeline, including data collection, training, real-time inferencing of deep neural networks, and continuous improvement. You’ll also be tasked with optimizing neural networks for higher throughput and lower latencies. Your ultimate goal will be to ensure that the data created by our system is delivered to—and used by—some of the world’s largest and most influential manufacturing companies.

Minimum Qualification
Bachelors EE or CS from top tier Engineering colleges
Solid computer science fundamentals - data structures, algorithms, design principles
Solid machine learning and neural network fundamentals
Fluency in C++ or Python
Preferred Qualification
Masters/PhD in Machine Learning/Computer Science or equivalent practical experience
Hands on experience with one or more DL libraries (Caffe/ Tensorflow/ PyTorch/ Keras/ etc)
Experience deploying DL/ML models in production involving GPUs, building deep network inference as a service
Experience building dataset pipelines, model management pipelines
Prior Experience with Cloud Platforms (GCP / AWS / Azure), Kubernetes, Containerisation
Experience with ML platforms such as SeldonCore, SageMaker, CloudML
Experience with large scale distributed systems (Hadoop, HBase, MapReduce, Spark, Storm, AWS Lambda)
Top five reasons to join Drishti

1. Work with visionaries who can execute. Do some research on our leadership team. Look at their patents and their publications. See how their histories intertwine with the biggest movements in the last 30 years of technology. And imagine being on a first-name basis with them.
2. Tackle a massive opportunity. Manufacturing is a $12T industry that still uses 100-year-old techniques to gather data on human tasks. Which means that people—who still perform up to 90% of factory activities—are effectively invisible to analytics. The demand for a solution couldn’t be larger. Why join a giant tech company when you can build one from the ground up?
3. Solve a myriad of unsolved problems. You’ll take on neural network model accuracy, high-volume video transit and storage, Big Data analysis and much more. It’s the challenge—and the madness, and the fun—of building an SAP on top of a Youtube on top of a Nest.
4. Lead the charge from Bangalore. Drishti is based in Silicon Valley, and funded by top venture capital investors that include Andreessen Horowitz, Emergence Capital and BGV. But—and this is critical for you—Drishti is building its product out of Bangalore itself. From our CTO on down, Bangalore is the heart and soul of Drishti’s engineering. You’ll be at the center of the action.
5. Pick up deep learning. Engineers at Drishti have the opportunity to rotate into our deep learning group, to work alongside some of the foremost experts in the field."

Join Drishti to solve a 100-year-old problem in a $12 trillion dollar market.
Deep learning-driven action recognition is the next frontier for AI. Build it with us.

Drishti’s mission is to “extend human potential in an increasingly automated world.” We’re driving true digital transformation in manufacturing by, for the first time since Henry Ford, making manual processes visible to factory analytics. We’re producing, collecting and analyzing massive amounts of data as we build manufacturing’s first and only solution for deep learning-driven action recognition.

About this role
Drishti’s Software Tools engineer is responsible for helping design and build Labelling Tools for self service portals for enabling customers to label the data sets and see the results of the datasets for analytics.

Five reasons to work at Drishti

1. Work with visionaries who can execute: Our leadership team is comprised of heavy hitters from the AI and deep learning world. Check out their patents and publications, and see how their histories intertwine with the biggest movements in the last 30 years of technology. And imagine being on a first name basis with them, solving hard technical problems side-by-side.
2. Tackle a massive market challenge: Manufacturing is a $12T industry that still uses 100-year-old techniques to gather data on human tasks. Which means that people, who still perform nearly 75 percent of factory activities, are effectively invisible to analytics. This situation severely hinders the decision-making abilities of the world’s largest manufacturing brands. The demand for a solution couldn’t be larger.
3. Do what you love – solve problems using tech: A problem of this magnitude requires the full force of technological solutions. You’ll take on neural network model accuracy, high-volume video transit and storage, Big Data analysis and much more. It’s the challenge – and the madness, and the fun – of building an SAP on top of a YouTube on top of a Nest.
4. Lead the charge from Bangalore: Drishti is based in Silicon Valley, and funded by top venture capital investors that include Andreessen Horowitz, Emergence Capital and BGV. But – and this is critical for you – Drishti is building its product out of Bangalore. From our CTO on down, Bangalore is the heart and soul of Drishti’s engineering. You’ll be at the center of the action.
5. Get exposure to deep learning: Deep learning technology is fundamental to what we do, and select engineers at Drishti have the opportunity to rotate into our deep learning group, to work alongside some of the foremost experts in the field."

About Us
Founded in 2017 and headquartered in Lower Manhattan, Accrete.AI is an artificial intelligence company that builds proprietary dynamic learning technologies called Knowledge Functions designed to boost analytical productivity. Accrete’s Knowledge Functions comprise of latent mathematical representations of tacit human knowledge that seed models that dynamically recalibrate neural architectures on the fly with minimal feedback, resolving issues related to catastrophic forgetting. As a result, Accrete’s Knowledge Functions capture and scale tacit knowledge by enabling machines to accurately understand and adapt to changing contexts. Accrete’s Knowledge Functions are powering domain specific applications that accurately filter self-promotion to identify authentically engaged users; gauge influence to predict viral potential; track the propagation of rumors; and more.
Backed in part by Dr. David Magerman, who helped found the equities trading group at the world leading quantitative hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, Accrete.AI began by building and licensing applications that would help financial analysts predict market-moving merger and acquisition rumors and transcribe and analyze scores of earnings calls simultaneously in real time with human level granularity and accuracy. Accrete has since expanded its stable of Knowledge Functions to build and license smart analytical tools across a variety of industries beyond financial services such as defense, real estate, music and collectibles.
We believe that the way humans conduct analytical work will undergo radical transformation over the next several years. Due to an explosion in digital information and cognitive limitations of the human brain, it is impossible for human analysts to capture the true complexity associated with forecasting future events using pre-defined factors. As such, we specialize in building dynamic, continuously learning models that automate complex cognitive tasks typically performed by human analysts. Our mission at Accrete.AI is to scale human expertise and compound the world's knowledge for the purpose of making accurate predictions about the real world that impact financial markets.
In addition, based in Lower Manhattan, Accrete has a majority interest in NYC based Shinrai, an AI Services subsidiary.
If you’re the right person for the job, we look forward to hearing from you."
"Architecture, Data, and Analytics Lead","Bengaluru, Karnataka",Citizengage,None,"You will build the foundation for us to emerge as one India’s leading cognitive computing companies. Whether it is thinking about scaling our architecture, getting your hands dirty with data-crunching or basic code, or finding novel insights for us to apply in creating self-managing communities through smart technology, your KPI will be the reduction in the ratio of human power needed to serve the citizens and businesses in our network. You will be responsible for our infrastructure, data, and algorithm layers. It’s a huge responsibility for the right visionary who has the experience to backup their ideas with rapid delivery.
Required Skills:
Architecture on the Cloud - You have deployed the latest plug-and-play infrastructure products to help rapidly growing startups scale. Evaluating the applicability and appropriateness of these solutions is second nature to you. Navigating the latest and greatest of AWS is child’s play. You have a track record of building stable and scalable back-end infrastructure. .
Security - Cloud and open-source are great but you understand the security and privacy concerns that accompany this wave and have deployed successful solutions to address these. We’re not just talking about just databases.
Data, Data, Data!!! - You live, breathe, and are obsessed with how to capture, store, and utilize data. Your first response to requests for something new are to sketch out diagrams of how the request would integrate with current architecture or what additional layers it would require. You’ve taken ownership of entire data flows in past organizations and are adept at translating ideas into prototypes overnight.
Optimization - A large part of what we do involves improving efficiency under various constraints.You need to be adept at algorithms and foster a deep interest in creating the foundation for cognitive computing and machine learning to thrive.
Team Builder - It’s not just about your individual talents - you’ve developed a team around creating intuitive and addictive user experiences and can channel the potential from young talent toward on-time and amazing products
Still a coder - Ready to get your hands dirty with code and taking responsibility for all aspects of launching new products.
Up for the Challenge - Working on a platform with multiple products is exciting to you and you can handle the multiple deadlines and integration challenges that accompany this style of working.
Startup Growth - You’ve taken products, companies, and teams at mobile and ideally logistics-related startups from Level 3 to Level 10 before and are wise about how to handle growth, when to ditch old code, and prioritize what needs to get done today and what can wait a few more months.
Respect for Experience - You’re not just an engineer who loves to work on the latest and greatest technology. What drives you is the kind of experience your code, architecture, and stack create, the feelings your users experience. You don’t necessarily need to design UI yourself but you should have respect and humility for user capacity and treat is as the key constraint to what we deploy.
Tech stack agnostic - What tools we’re using only matters to you at a level of optimization, efficiency, and future capability. Other than this, you should feel comfortable switching between languages and frameworks with a broad exposure to multiple toolsets. Use of Clojure and other functional programming languages is a bonus.
Nice to have:
Geospatial Data - Experience with geospatial data and interfaces, especially leveraging open source resources.
Supply Chain/Logistics - Track record of building products in the logistics, hyper-local delivery, or supply chain management space with a broad range of users and multiple integrations with external tools, including payment gateways and social media sign-in’s.
Data Visualization - Data visualization expertise and background of simplifying analytics.
Telephony - Integration experience with telephony providers (SMS, IVR, etc.).
Hardware/Sensors - Hardware integration with sensors, mobile add-ons, and other technologies in the Smart Cities space.

"Architecture, Data, and Analytics Lead","Bengaluru, Karnataka",Citizengage,None,"You will build the foundation for us to emerge as one India’s leading cognitive computing companies. Whether it is thinking about scaling our architecture, getting your hands dirty with data-crunching or basic code, or finding novel insights for us to apply in creating self-managing communities through smart technology, your KPI will be the reduction in the ratio of human power needed to serve the citizens and businesses in our network. You will be responsible for our infrastructure, data, and algorithm layers. It’s a huge responsibility for the right visionary who has the experience to backup their ideas with rapid delivery.
Required Skills:
Architecture on the Cloud - You have deployed the latest plug-and-play infrastructure products to help rapidly growing startups scale. Evaluating the applicability and appropriateness of these solutions is second nature to you. Navigating the latest and greatest of AWS is child’s play. You have a track record of building stable and scalable back-end infrastructure. .
Security - Cloud and open-source are great but you understand the security and privacy concerns that accompany this wave and have deployed successful solutions to address these. We’re not just talking about just databases.
Data, Data, Data!!! - You live, breathe, and are obsessed with how to capture, store, and utilize data. Your first response to requests for something new are to sketch out diagrams of how the request would integrate with current architecture or what additional layers it would require. You’ve taken ownership of entire data flows in past organizations and are adept at translating ideas into prototypes overnight.
Optimization - A large part of what we do involves improving efficiency under various constraints.You need to be adept at algorithms and foster a deep interest in creating the foundation for cognitive computing and machine learning to thrive.
Team Builder - It’s not just about your individual talents - you’ve developed a team around creating intuitive and addictive user experiences and can channel the potential from young talent toward on-time and amazing products
Still a coder - Ready to get your hands dirty with code and taking responsibility for all aspects of launching new products.
Up for the Challenge - Working on a platform with multiple products is exciting to you and you can handle the multiple deadlines and integration challenges that accompany this style of working.
Startup Growth - You’ve taken products, companies, and teams at mobile and ideally logistics-related startups from Level 3 to Level 10 before and are wise about how to handle growth, when to ditch old code, and prioritize what needs to get done today and what can wait a few more months.
Respect for Experience - You’re not just an engineer who loves to work on the latest and greatest technology. What drives you is the kind of experience your code, architecture, and stack create, the feelings your users experience. You don’t necessarily need to design UI yourself but you should have respect and humility for user capacity and treat is as the key constraint to what we deploy.
Tech stack agnostic - What tools we’re using only matters to you at a level of optimization, efficiency, and future capability. Other than this, you should feel comfortable switching between languages and frameworks with a broad exposure to multiple toolsets. Use of Clojure and other functional programming languages is a bonus.
Nice to have:
Geospatial Data - Experience with geospatial data and interfaces, especially leveraging open source resources.
Supply Chain/Logistics - Track record of building products in the logistics, hyper-local delivery, or supply chain management space with a broad range of users and multiple integrations with external tools, including payment gateways and social media sign-in’s.
Data Visualization - Data visualization expertise and background of simplifying analytics.
Telephony - Integration experience with telephony providers (SMS, IVR, etc.).

"Architecture, Data, Analytics Lead","Bengaluru, Karnataka",Citizengage,None,"You will build the foundation for us to emerge as one India’s leading cognitive computing companies. Whether it is thinking about scaling our architecture, getting your hands dirty with data-crunching or basic code, or finding novel insights for us to apply in creating self-managing communities through smart technology, your KPI will be the reduction in the ratio of human power needed to serve the citizens and businesses in our network. You will be responsible for our infrastructure, data, and algorithm layers. It’s a huge responsibility for the right visionary who has the experience to backup their ideas with rapid delivery.
Required Skills:
Architecture on the Cloud - You have deployed the latest plug-and-play infrastructure products to help rapidly growing startups scale. Evaluating the applicability and appropriateness of these solutions is second nature to you. Navigating the latest and greatest of AWS is child’s play. You have a track record of building stable and scalable back-end infrastructure. .
Security - Cloud and open-source are great but you understand the security and privacy concerns that accompany this wave and have deployed successful solutions to address these. We’re not just talking about just databases.
Data, Data, Data!!! - You live, breathe, and are obsessed with how to capture, store, and utilize data. Your first response to requests for something new are to sketch out diagrams of how the request would integrate with current architecture or what additional layers it would require. You’ve taken ownership of entire data flows in past organizations and are adept at translating ideas into prototypes overnight.
Optimization - A large part of what we do involves improving efficiency under various constraints.You need to be adept at algorithms and foster a deep interest in creating the foundation for cognitive computing and machine learning to thrive.
Team Builder - It’s not just about your individual talents - you’ve developed a team around creating intuitive and addictive user experiences and can channel the potential from young talent toward on-time and amazing products
Still a coder - Ready to get your hands dirty with code and taking responsibility for all aspects of launching new products.
Up for the Challenge - Working on a platform with multiple products is exciting to you and you can handle the multiple deadlines and integration challenges that accompany this style of working.
Startup Growth - You’ve taken products, companies, and teams at mobile and ideally logistics-related startups from Level 3 to Level 10 before and are wise about how to handle growth, when to ditch old code, and prioritize what needs to get done today and what can wait a few more months.
Respect for Experience - You’re not just an engineer who loves to work on the latest and greatest technology. What drives you is the kind of experience your code, architecture, and stack create, the feelings your users experience. You don’t necessarily need to design UI yourself but you should have respect and humility for user capacity and treat is as the key constraint to what we deploy.
Tech stack agnostic - What tools we’re using only matters to you at a level of optimization, efficiency, and future capability. Other than this, you should feel comfortable switching between languages and frameworks with a broad exposure to multiple toolsets. Use of Clojure and other functional programming languages is a bonus.
Nice to have:
Geospatial Data - Experience with geospatial data and interfaces, especially leveraging open source resources.
Supply Chain/Logistics - Track record of building products in the logistics, hyper-local delivery, or supply chain management space with a broad range of users and multiple integrations with external tools, including payment gateways and social media sign-in’s.
Data Visualization - Data visualization expertise and background of simplifying analytics.
Telephony - Integration experience with telephony providers (SMS, IVR, etc.).
Hardware/Sensors - Hardware integration with sensors, mobile add-ons, and other technologies in the Smart Cities space.
Waste Management - Passion for the waste management space and an intuitive understanding of on-ground realities that constrain technology options."

About SquadVoice

SquadVoice (https://www.squadvoice.in/) is the smartest way for consumer companies to increase lead outreach and engagement to increase sales conversions massively.
Sales teams are unable to keep up with thousands of unqualified leads and need speed, rigour, and analytics to service leads at the right time with the right message. This gap between marketing and sales results in poor conversions, high cost of acquisition, and missed targets.
We convert more leads to revenue opportunities using smart, data-optimized campaigns across calls, texts, and emails along with on-demand, industry-ready callers present across India.
We're able to drive a 2-5x increase in revenue opportunities with 40% more ROI vs. in-house or outsourced teams.

Our groundbreaking technology, services delivery, and intelligence gathering together with our innovations in machine learning and behavioral-based detection, allow our customers to not only defend themselves, but do so in a future-proof manner. We’ve earned numerous honors and top rankings for our technology, organization and people – clearly confirming our industry leadership and our special culture driving it. We also offer flexible work arrangements to help our people manage their personal and professional lives in a way that works for them. So if you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let’s talk.
About the Role
The CrowdStrike Malware Research Center is the core of Falcon’s malware detection and response capabilities. The team has a focus on understanding the threat landscape and sets the target for what Falcon should be identifying and preventing. Additionally, the MRC is responsible for understanding our capabilities, and mapping how well our machine learning and behavioral protection capabilities are doing against those threats. Where there is a gap, the MRC takes action to improve our detection stance, and improve our overall protection story. There are many parts of CrowdStrike working towards protecting customer environments, and the MRC works across all of them to ensure we are on target and providing the best protection for our current Threat landscape.
Threat Research Team
Leading the charge for understanding the activity of malware today is the Threat Research team. With a focus on malware research, the primary role of the team is to understand relevant threats and techniques used in malware that is threatening our customer’s business. The challenge is the enormous scale of malware today and sheer number of samples required to be addressed. This takes a more creative approach than traditional Anti-Virus research, focusing on one sample at a time. The modern threat lab requires an economy of scale through automation and machine learning to allow people to focus on new learnings, and let systems continue to identify malware based on what the team has learned.
Manager, Threat Research
With a challenging role comes the requirement for a skilled manager with a background in threat research and reverse engineering.
Leading a team of threat researchers requires solid people managing skills for helping grow the team and supporting them in being successful in the organization.
Additionally, the team’s manager must have a solid understanding of the technical requirements of the positions reporting to them in order to provide proper guidance and help grow the team’s technical skills.
Requirements
The technical Manager position in CrowdStrike is not defined as a progression from an individual contributor. It is a unique career path focusing on excellence in supporting the business through scaling out their technical expertise while also focusing on supporting a team of candidates from new college hires to senior engineers.
There is minimal hands on threat research in the role, but the expectation of having the background and prior experience with the role is required.
This is a career track where you transition from your individual contributor role to being a leader and mentor to the organization, providing guidance, understanding business requirements, and helping your team achieve success in those requirements.
Solid interpersonal skills are a must, along with a strong sense of empathy, to help guide employees through understanding where they are in their career and technical path.
A proven background in advanced reverse engineering on file-based threats is required.
Additional reverse engineering around file-less threats, exploits, and other attach techniques are desirable to be demonstrated at a moderate skill level.
A good working knowledge of malware based automation workflows and techniques is required.
Efficiency of the team is important and can only be achieved in today’s malware environment through a high degree of automation.
The Threat Research team is supported by an engineering team, but proof of concept automation is produced by researchers. Showing competence handing off research to engineering to produce results is required.
Bachelors or Masters in Computer Science or comparable field required.
8+ year’s experience in the threat research field with a focus on malware analysis required.
Strong interpersonal communications skills required, with the ability to demonstrate leadership and team building expertise required.

We are Lockers team! We solve the problem of package delivery to customers. A lot of time Amazon customers have to go through hassles of coordinating delivery time with carriers and are not able to receive their packages. We solve this problem for them. We allow customer to get their package (and do their returns) when and where they want. In other words, we make the package delivery asynchronous in nature. Is that an important problem? Draw a comparison with how messaging solutions like AWS SQS / JMS are critical part of tech architecture, the same way we are becoming important to package delivery.

We have been in existence for last 8 years, have a network of 10K lockers in 12+ countries, and deliver millions of package a month. However, we still call ourselves a startup. This is because of how we operate and how we are scaling. We have our key stakeholders and dependencies under single leadership. We take quick decision and move fast on them. In last 3 years, we have launched 2 brand new successful products. This year, we have started working on a new product which will transform the way we look at lockers. We plan to create lockers which will run without any internet and power connections for years. These lockers will be installed at public places with ease and made discover-able to customers in real-time. This will allow us to scale 10x in next 3 years (which is what we have signed-up for!)

In this role, you will get breadth & depth of experience. Our org will build package pickup capability in MShop (biggest shopping app in the World), package delivery capabilities in Rabbit (one of the biggest Carrier App), maintenance capabilities in our own Administrator App, firmware in cutting edge technologies like RUST and multiple backend highly scalable services using native AWS technologies; most of it to be built from scratch. The team will we be working with multiple partners from vendors in China to Lab126 in SFO. As part of this team, you will see all these things coming together under the same roof and will see it making a major impact in next 1 year!

You will lead and coordinate design/implementation efforts, coordinating across multiple teams to develop optimal solutions. You will be expected to create a roadmap, align with business partners on prioritization, propose appropriate tradeoffs, clearly communicate goals, roles, responsibilities, and desired outcomes to leadership and stakeholders. You will also establish planning mechanisms to deliver on your roadmap, demonstrate strong operational excellence and maintain a high code quality bar. You will be expected to deep dive into complex business use cases and system dependencies and work backwards from the customer to propose solutions that solve business and customer needs.

Engineering Manager,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",Rebel Foods,None,"About Us:
World’s leading consumer companies are all internet / technology / new age companies -
Amazon (retail), Airbnb / Oyo (Hospitality), Priceline (travel), Netflix / Spotify (Entertainment). The only sector, where traditional companies are still the largest ones is restaurants. McDonald’s market cap is 130 BN USD. With Food Delivery growing exponentially worldwide, there is an opportunity to build world’s most valuable restaurant company on the internet superfast. We have the formula to be that company. Today, we can safely say we are world’s largest delivery only / internet restaurant company, and by a wide margin. At 2200+ individual internet restaurants, in 30 + Indian cities, 3 in UAE, 17 + in Indonesia and 2 in the UK and expanding further, we have indeed come a long way. It’s still Day 1, but we know we are onto something very, very big. We have an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to change a 500-year-old industry. For more detail on how we are changing the restaurant industry from the core, using the power of the internet, please refer below. It’s important reading if you want to know our company better and really explore working with us:

While after reading this, the WHAT would be pretty clear, we would also want you to go through the HOW part, which is not just about the Multi-brand business model, but the “Way of working” a.k.a “Values” at Rebel Foods. These so-called values are not mere A3 printouts hung up on wall but actually the sugar- phosphate backbone of the DNA of each one of us making this happen (finally we made you open the google tab, at least for few of you). This is the only OLD part of ours we retain in our journey of achieving NEW milestones and frontiers day in and out.

Engineering History @ Rebel
In order to understand more about the challenges that you might face at Rebel, it’s important that we go back to the inception and get acquainted about our journey till date. From the times when excel sheets served as our POS system at stores having one brand, to our evolution as a company that uses smart kitchens - we have traversed the phone, web and app channels over time. From being a single brand restaurant, we moved to being a parent company with a dozen restaurant brands under the umbrella, while simultaneously moving our operations from a single kitchen to more than 300 locations across 30 cities in India and in a few International locations.
The team of engineers at Rebel has built one of the most unique platforms in the world that can not only help operate a kitchen with multiple brands, but also aids in operating business at scale. To give you additional perspective, the team has built more than 40+ products in the last 4.5 years. The innovation spans through technologies like polygon architecture (dynamic delivery radius) for a multi-brand operation from a kitchen, to managing each step of the kitchen ops —queuing, load / prep time, batching of orders, out of the door algorithms; inventory prediction based on consumption data, personal recommendation engine, deep integration with every aggregator, last mile delivery app, CRM systems, multiple brand websites and apps, reporting and analytics systems, and more. Everything that was mentioned has been built on a tech stack developed by our Engineers. This enabled us to tackle the massive complexity of a multi-brand operation while keeping all parts of the business supremely efficient and optimized.

Future of Engineering @ Rebel We are now building Engineering 2.0 at our company. Thevision is to make technology the Brain ( AI, Machine Learning, analytics to drive every business decision of the company), the Body (robotics led automation at our Kitchens, driving tremendous operational efficiency) and the Mind ( building an AI/ ML driven virtual personal butler for customers across app, web and voice, like Netflix of food) at Rebel. This will mean working across technologies and product / engineering teams to build solutions that would be “first - time” in the world. Engineering @ Rebel will break new grounds."

"Architecture, Data, and Analytics Lead","Bengaluru, Karnataka",Citizengage,None,"You will build the foundation for us to emerge as one India’s leading cognitive computing companies. Whether it is thinking about scaling our architecture, getting your hands dirty with data-crunching or basic code, or finding novel insights for us to apply in creating self-managing communities through smart technology, your KPI will be the reduction in the ratio of human power needed to serve the citizens and businesses in our network. You will be responsible for our infrastructure, data, and algorithm layers. It’s a huge responsibility for the right visionary who has the experience to backup their ideas with rapid delivery.
Required Skills:
Architecture on the Cloud - You have deployed the latest plug-and-play infrastructure products to help rapidly growing startups scale. Evaluating the applicability and appropriateness of these solutions is second nature to you. Navigating the latest and greatest of AWS is child’s play. You have a track record of building stable and scalable back-end infrastructure. .
Security - Cloud and open-source are great but you understand the security and privacy concerns that accompany this wave and have deployed successful solutions to address these. We’re not just talking about just databases.
Data, Data, Data!!! - You live, breathe, and are obsessed with how to capture, store, and utilize data. Your first response to requests for something new are to sketch out diagrams of how the request would integrate with current architecture or what additional layers it would require. You’ve taken ownership of entire data flows in past organizations and are adept at translating ideas into prototypes overnight.
Optimization - A large part of what we do involves improving efficiency under various constraints.You need to be adept at algorithms and foster a deep interest in creating the foundation for cognitive computing and machine learning to thrive.
Team Builder - It’s not just about your individual talents - you’ve developed a team around creating intuitive and addictive user experiences and can channel the potential from young talent toward on-time and amazing products
Still a coder - Ready to get your hands dirty with code and taking responsibility for all aspects of launching new products.
Up for the Challenge - Working on a platform with multiple products is exciting to you and you can handle the multiple deadlines and integration challenges that accompany this style of working.
Startup Growth - You’ve taken products, companies, and teams at mobile and ideally logistics-related startups from Level 3 to Level 10 before and are wise about how to handle growth, when to ditch old code, and prioritize what needs to get done today and what can wait a few more months.
Respect for Experience - You’re not just an engineer who loves to work on the latest and greatest technology. What drives you is the kind of experience your code, architecture, and stack create, the feelings your users experience. You don’t necessarily need to design UI yourself but you should have respect and humility for user capacity and treat is as the key constraint to what we deploy.
Tech stack agnostic - What tools we’re using only matters to you at a level of optimization, efficiency, and future capability. Other than this, you should feel comfortable switching between languages and frameworks with a broad exposure to multiple toolsets. Use of Clojure and other functional programming languages is a bonus.
Nice to have:
Geospatial Data - Experience with geospatial data and interfaces, especially leveraging open source resources.
Supply Chain/Logistics - Track record of building products in the logistics, hyper-local delivery, or supply chain management space with a broad range of users and multiple integrations with external tools, including payment gateways and social media sign-in’s.
Data Visualization - Data visualization expertise and background of simplifying analytics.
Telephony - Integration experience with telephony providers (SMS, IVR, etc.).
Hardware/Sensors - Hardware integration with sensors, mobile add-ons, and other technologies in the Smart Cities space.
Waste Management - Passion for the waste management space and an intuitive understanding of on-ground realities that constrain technology options."

On-call experience with production grade systems We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool."

We use Django rest framework and Postgresql to provide our primary REST API interface. Our web-app is built using react. AWS SQS queues are then used to distribute work to a variety of processing systems / microservices which use a combination of commodity analytics APIs (e.g. aws transcribe, google speech, aws rekognition) and bespoke algorithms and models (e.g. tensorflow) to provide speech, image and video analytics.
As you would expect our system also provides various collaboration, administration, management and security related features around the central video capture and analytics.
We offer both shared and dedicated deployments of the software; by defining all of our infrastructure as code we are able to easily deploy dedicated copies of our entire system into dedicated VPCs for our large customers.

We Are Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool."

We Are Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool."
